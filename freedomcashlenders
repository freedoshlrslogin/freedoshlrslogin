A business credit card could cover the same expenses as a line of credit, though not all cards will have OnDeckâ€™s $100,000 credit limit. The difference between a business credit card and line of credit is that you can avoid paying interest if you consistently pay the balance in full each month.

If you are charged interest on a credit card, you may be able to pay less than you would with OnDeck, which starts rates at 29.9 percent. The best small business credit cards tend to offer interest rates in the 18 percent to 30 percent range. Credit cards also give you the benefit of cash back or points that you can redeem for travel or purchases.

PayPal’s business loans give you the chance to fund small expenses as low as $1,000 or $5,000, depending on which loan you choose. It also keeps its loans accessible to less-established businesses than traditional lenders accept.

For example, its short-term loan requires a personal credit score of 580 and low annual revenue of $33,300. Its working capital loan doesn’t check your credit and accepts annual revenue as low as $15,000, provided that revenue is streamed through a PayPal business account. These lending requirements are some of the lowest possible in the online loan landscape.

Its working capital loan works like a merchant cash advance because you repay the loan out of a percentage of each PayPal sale. Once approved, you can get funding within minutes.
